# Dashboard_1day
I made a simple dashboard in a short amount of time
 the data are from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses/data
All the feature engineering is done in the Python file, but the CSV file is too big to be uploaded on Git Hub.
The graphs are pretty basic, they are just interactive. The main goal of the dashboard is to help someone choose what is the best time and place to book their flight to avoid delays
